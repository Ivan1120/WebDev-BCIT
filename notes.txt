Critical response
Edge of Tomorrow received largely positive reviews from critics,[89] who praised the humor, the aliens' design, Cruise and Blunt's performances, and the time-loop premise's ability to remain fresh. However, some critics had issues with the film's conclusion.[90] Based on 296 reviews, review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 90% of critics gave the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7.5 out of 10. The website's critical consensus reads: "Gripping, well-acted, funny, and clever, Edge of Tomorrow offers entertaining proof that Tom Cruise is still more than capable of shouldering the weight of a blockbuster action thriller."[91] Another aggregator, Metacritic, surveyed 43 critics and assessed 35 reviews as positive and 8 as mixed, with none negative. Based on the reviews, it gave the film a score of 71 out of 100, which it said indicated "generally favorable reviews".[92]
