          <p>Edge of Tomorrow received largely positive reviews from critics,[89] who praised the humor, the aliens' design,
              Cruise and Blunt's performances, and the time-loop premise's ability to remain fresh. However, some critics had
              issues with the film's conclusion.[90] Based on 296 reviews, review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports
              that 90% of critics gave the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7.5 out of 10. The website's critical
              consensus reads: "Gripping, well-acted, funny, and clever, Edge of Tomorrow offers entertaining proof that Tom
              Cruise is still more than capable of shouldering the weight of a blockbuster action thriller."[91]</p>

          <p>Chang said that the screenwriters,
              with the assistance of the editors, "tell their story in a breezy narrative shorthand (and at times, sleight-of-hand),
              transforming what must surely be an unbelievably tedious gauntlet for our hero into a deft, playful and continually
              involving viewing experience". Regarding the relationship between Cruise and Blunt's characters, Chang said "Liman
              handles it with a pleasing lightness of touch that extends to the proceedings as a whole." He also commended
              the visual effects of the "expertly designed Mimics" as well as Dion Beebe's cinematography.</p>

          too distant future he would be Tom Cruise, one of the top 100 movie stars of all time, he would have probably grinned
          and told you that his ambition was to join the priesthood. Nonetheless, this sensitive, deeply religious ...</p>
